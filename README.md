- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nolwenno, a french web dev student
- ✏️ I’m interested in learning new things (like, everything, I'm curious !) 
- 🌱 Currently studying Web Development and Accessibility at [Ecole O'clock](https://oclock.io/)
- 🌈 I'm kind of a serial hobbyist : sewing, embroidery, badminton, dance, horse-riding, upholstery.. You name it. But my one love since I'm a child is : violin 🎻 
- 📌 I’m looking to collaborate on everything, but I'm still learning so... 
- 📫 How to reach me : [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nolwenn-maheut-257b3521b/)
